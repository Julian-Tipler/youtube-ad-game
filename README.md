## How it should work
When a youtube video loads up, if an ad is playing, include a fun mini-game (or for now a fun fact) as a div on top
Also mute the video until the real video starts
Have the inspirational qoute dissapear when the video starts

I make money on the plus version which offers more features in place of the default qoute


## Potential problems
How to know when the actual video has started
May need some way of differentiating the ad(s) from the video
